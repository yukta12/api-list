# API LIST

A collective list of free APIs for use in software and web development.
Basically the whole point is to create a central repository for all the API's list known to us.
So we don't need to scratch our heads when we need the api.

You are most welcome to add a api that isn't included yet.

You can find the guides for Contribution Or ***How to get Started*** from [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)
